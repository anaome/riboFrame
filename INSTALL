Program installation

What will follow here has been tested on Ubuntu Thrusty Tahr only.

The package riboFrame is composed by two perl scripts, riboTrap.pl and riboMap.pl that can be downloaded from the link above. A minimal Perl installation is sufficient and needed for the scripts to work.

Two other programs are required, that constitute the working ground of the riboFrame scripts:

    Eddy's HMMER3 (hmmer.janelia.org)
    RDP's RDPclassifier (rdp.cme.msu.edu)

HMMER3 should be in your distro's repositories and can be easily installed with your package manager. Then you will have HMMER compiled binaries, among which hmmsearch. 
RDPclassifier can be obtained from http://sourceforge.net/projects/rdp-classifier/ . We will use the java jar file RDPclassifier[...].jar

Lastly, you will have to download the Hidden Markov Models of the 16S gene for bacteria and archea form this repository and store to some desired location.

Thta's all, take a look at file GUIDE.txt for a complete guide to riboFrame or at EXAMPLE.txt for an example run of riboFrame
